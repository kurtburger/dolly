		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p>Hey y'all! It's me! Dolly! I'm an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, actress, author, businesswoman, and philanthropist, known primarily for my work in country music. After achieving success as a songwriter for others, I made my album debut in 1967, with my album "Hello, I'm Dolly." </p>

		<p> With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with Porter Wagoner), my sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s; my subsequent albums in the later part of the 1990s were lower in sales. However, in the new millennium, I achieved commercial success again and has released albums on independent labels since 2000, including albums on my own label, Dolly Records.</p>
